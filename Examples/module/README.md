# TreeElement Example
[Example of use of TreeElement module.](https://raw.githack.com/anhr/TreeElementNodeJS/master/Examples/module/)


## Packaged Builds
The easiest way to use TreeElement Example in your code is by using the built source at `build/treeElementExample.js`. These built JavaScript files bundle all the necessary dependencies to run TreeElement.

In your `head` tag, include the following code:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://anhr.github.io/TreeElement/myTreeView.css" type="text/css">
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/anhr/treeElementNodeJS/master/Examples/module/build/treeElementExample.js"></script>
```

Now you can use window.myTreeView for append of a Tree element into your web page.
