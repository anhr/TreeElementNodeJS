# TreeElement
node.js version of the TreeElement


## Packaged Builds
The easiest way to use TreeElement in your code is by using the built source at `build/treeElement.js`. These built JavaScript files bundle all the necessary dependencies to run TreeElement.

In your `head` tag, include the following code:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://anhr.github.io/TreeElement/myTreeView.css" type="text/css">
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/anhr/treeElementNodeJS/master/build/treeElement.js"></script>
```

Now you can use window.myTreeView for append of a Tree element into your web page.

## Append simple tree 

```
	element
```

## Directory Contents

```
└── build - Compiled source code.
```

## Building your own TreeElement

In the terminal, enter the following:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## npm scripts

- npm run build - Build development and production version of scripts.
